Ultrakill inspired momentum movement mechanics
right hand (main) has an explosive magic punch/blast attack spell skill
left hand (special) holding grappling hook/[insert something else that is cool)
Dude could be comically evil (maybe)

Beginning scene:
Screen welcoming player, 
introducing as worker of Evil Pixels Inc.
reporting general mission

Plan:
1. Get movement dynamics done
2. build map area, test out movement
3. add interactable elements (any action game needs explosives)
4. test elements direct activation or via movement activation or chain reaction activation
5. design/aesthetics

Punchline (WIP):
What if a Movement Shooter had no guns?
